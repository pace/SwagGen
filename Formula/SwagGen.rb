    # libxml2 has to be included in ISYSTEM_PATH for building one of
    # dependencies. It didn't happen automatically before Xcode 9.3
    # so homebrew patched environment variable to get it work.
    #
    # That works fine when you have just Xcode installed, but there
    # is also CLT. If it is also installed, ISYSTEM_PATH has
    # a reference to CLT libxml2 AND a reference to Xcode default
    # toolchain libxml2. That causes build failure with "module redeclared"
    # error. So if both Xcode and CLT are installed one reference
    # has to be removed.
    #
    # It's a bug of homebrew but before it's fixed, it's easier
    # to provide in-place workaround for now.
    # Please remove this once homebrew is patched.

    # step 1: capture old value and patch environment
